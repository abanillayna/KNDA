            <p class="texts2">A <i style="color: black;">crown</i> completely encases the tooth. 
                In order to prepare the tooth for a crown, more of the tooth must be filed or ground down.<br><br>
                If you have <i style="color: black;">tooth decay</i>, your dentist will first make the crown by removing the decayed portion of the tooth.
                Your tooth may need to be strengthened in this situation in order to sustain the crown.<br><br>
                If your <i style="color: black;">tooth is injured</i>, it can also require rebuilding.
                 For this operation, a local anesthetic could be used on you.

                <h3 style="color: black;">TYPES OF CROWN</h3> <br>

                  <dt style="color: black;">1. Gold Crown</dt><br>
                    <dd style="color: black;">Actually, copper and other metals, such nickel
                      or chromium, are combined to create gold crowns. 
                      Strongness and durability are the key benefits of gold crowns.<br><br>

                      Some dentists may advise a gold crown as the best choice for back 
                      restorations, depending on the demands of each patient. The hue 
                      and appearance of gold crowns, however, prevent them from 
                      being a very popular option today.</dd> <br>

                      <h6 style="color: black;">ADVANTAGES:</h6>
                      <ul>
                        <li style="color: black;">They have great strength and resistance.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">If properly maintained, they have a long lifespan.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">Your natural teeth need to be removed in less proportion.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">Much like natural enamel, they deteriorate gradually.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">The back teeth, particularly the second molars, are the perfect candidates for them.</li>
                      </ul> 
                      <br>

                      <h6 style="color: black;">DISADVANTAGES:</h6>
                      <ul>
                        <li style="color: black;">Poor aesthetics: They are definitely not real teeth.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">Poor aesthetics: They are definitely not real teeth.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">Some people may be affected by gold alloy crowns and have negative side effects like allergic reactions or edema.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <dt style="color: black;"> 2. All Porcelain Crowns</dt><br>
                    <dd style="color: black;">This is undoubtedly the most common style of 
                      crown in use today. They are totally composed of porcelain.</dd>

                      <h6 style="color: black;">ADVANTAGES:</h6>
                      <ul>
                        <li style="color: black;">The best and most natural-looking crowns are made 
                          of porcelain or ceramic.  They are the same size, 
                          color, and shape as your neighboring teeth.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">The ideal solution for restoring front teeth.</li>
                        <li style="color: black;">Since no metal is utilized and they are biocompatible, they are toxic-free.</li>
                      </ul>
                      

                      <h6 style="color: black;">DISADVANTAGES</h6>
                      <ul>
                        <li style="color: black;">They lack the durability of metal crowns. 
                          Porcelain crowns can survive a very long time, 
                          but only if they receive proper care.</li>
                          <li style="color: black;">Patients with bruxism should choose gold of PFM.</li>
                          <li style="color: black;">They might cost more than other crown kinds, such metal crowns, do.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <dt style="color: black;">3.	Porcelain Fused-to-Metal Crowns (PFM)</dt><br>
                      <dd style="color: black;"> Another common kind of dental crown is one made 
                        of porcelain fused to metal (PFM). Due to their metal 
                        construction, they offer both strength and aesthetic 
                        appeal thanks to the porcelain coating on the cap.</dd>

                        <h6 style="color: black;">ADVANTAGES:</h6>
                        <ul>
                          <li style="color: black;">They offer excellent durability and beauty.</li>
                          <li style="color: black;">They have existed for more than 50 years. We are aware of their effectiveness.</li>
                          <li style="color: black;">They are less expensive than porcelain crowns in general.</li>
                        </ul>

                      

                        <h6 style="color: black;">DISAVANTAGES:</h6>
                        <ul>
                          <li style="color: black;">These crowns' metal components could result in 
                            a grey line at the gumline. This might not provide 
                            the same level of visual appeal as all porcelain crowns do.</li>
                          <li style="color: black;">This kind of crown may be more prone to breaking against 
                            the neighboring teeth in the case of those who grind their teeth.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <dt style="color: black;">4. Zirconia Crowns</dt><br>
                        <dd style="color: black;">Zirconium is a relatively new substance 
                          that blends porcelain crown beauty with metal strength.  
                          Recently, high translucent and layered zirconia crowns 
                          have become in popularity.</dd>

                          <h6 style="color: black;">ADVANTAGES:</h6>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="color: black;">They offer wonderful aesthetics.</li>
                            <li style="color: black;">They have a low chance of chipping or cracking and are sturdy and durable.</li>
                            <li style="color: black;">Since zirconia may be cut and shaped in the same dentist facility, the procedure 
                              might take less time. Sending them to a dental lab is not necessary.</li>
                            <li style="color: black;">Due of its resilience, zirconia crowns are less likely to 
                              deteriorate over time.</li>
                            <li style="color: black;">As metal-free crowns, they are biocompatible and unlikely to trigger allergic responses.</li>
                          </ul>
                        
                          <h6 style="color: black;">DISADVANTAGES:</h6>
                          <ul>
                            <li style="color: black;">The teeth they bite down on can rapidly become worn out due to their power.</li>
                            <li style="color: black;">Adjusting solid zirconia might be challenging.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <dt style="color: black;">5. E- MAX: Lithium Disilicate Crowns</dt><br>
                          <dd style="color: black;">E-Max crowns are now the newest form of crowns 
                            used in dentistry. It is a specific kind of lightweight, 
                            thin, all-ceramic crown composed of lithium disilicate.</dd>

                              <li style="color: black;">When doing numerous units, some dental professionals

            <p class="texts2">Only the front of your tooth is covered with a<i style="color: black;"> veneer</i>.
                Due to the preparation leaving more of your natural tooth unaltered, 
                they are <i style="color: black;">less intrusive</i> than crowns.<br><br>
                To prepare the tooth's enamel for bonding the veneer, around 0.5 millimeter of 
                the tooth's front enamel is ground down.
                Certain more recent veneer kinds don't require as much grinding of the tooth surface.
                Because the grinding could be uncomfortable, you might need a local anesthetic.<br><br>
                You need enough enamel on your tooth for a veneer to attach to it in order for it to function correctly.

                <h3 style="color: black;">TYPES OF VENEERS</h3><br>
                <dl>
                  <dt style="color: black;">1. Porcelain Veneers</dt><br>
                  <dd style="color: black;">The most realistic-looking dental treatment on the market 
                    right now is porcelain veneers. They are used to address a 
                    variety of cosmetic issues, such as straightening up crooked teeth, 
                    fixing small cosmetic flaws like gaps and chipping, and repairing stained 
                    or discolored teeth. <br><br>
                    
                    Veneers can be used to replace a single tooth or a number of 
                    teeth. In certain instances, a porcelain veneer just needs to cover 
                    a little amount of your natural tooth, but in other instances, a non-removable 
                    veneer must completely cover the tooth. Because more tooth-colored material can 
                    be obtained with this surgery than with porcelain veneers, it is growing in popularity.<br><br>

                    Porcelain veneers are an option for some people. If you have healthy gums and 
                    no history of gum disease, porcelain is a fantastic alternative. Additionally, 
                    it is feasible to have restorative porcelain veneers that can cover up crowns and 
                    bridges that don't fit properly due to tooth decay or prior injuries.
                  </dd><br>

                  <dt style="color: black;">2. Porcelain-Fused to Metal Veneers</dt><br>
                  <dd style="color: black;">These veneers need to be more durable than porcelain 
                    veneers alone since they often give teeth a more natural 
                    appearance. These can be created from ceramics and gold alloys, 
                    giving your teeth more durability and strength. These veneers further 
                    speed up the process because they employ layers of materials rather 
                    than a single substance, as with the other two alternatives.</dd><br>

                  <dt style="color: black;">3. Resin Veneers</dt><br>
                  <dd style="color: black;">These veneers are the strongest kind available. 
                    They are capable of coping with high-stress circumstances 
                    like clenching and grinding. They look very much like natural 
                    teeth but don't require as much preparation time as porcelain veneers.</dd><br>

                  <dt style="color: black;">4. Composite Veneers</dt><br>
                  <dd style="color: black;">Because they can get more tooth-colored material 
                    with cosmetic bonding treatments than with porcelain 
                    veneers, composite veneers are a good option if you 
                    already have dental work or want to improve the appearance 
                    of your teeth without changing their color. Composite veneers 
                    also don't require any modifications to your natural teeth, 
                    can usually be completed in fewer office visits, and are less expensive.</dd><br>

                    <dt style="color: black;">5. Zirconia Veneers</dt><br>
                    <dd style="color: black;">Zirconia veneers are an excellent choice if your 
                      tooth is too damaged to be properly restored with porcelain 
                      or composite veneers. They can replace teeth with significant 
                      decay, cracks, and chips because they are constructed of a 
                      sturdy ceramic substance. Zirconia veneers will also survive 
                      longer than other varieties of porcelain veneers due to its 
                      resistance to damage from acidic meals and beverages. 
                      They also have a very natural appearance, making them perfect 
                      for anyone who wishes to improve the appearance of their smile 
                      without significantly altering the existing dental work.</dd><br>

                    <dt style="color: black;">6. Lumineers Veneers</dt><br>
                    <dd style="color: black;">Lumineers are a terrific option if you're thinking about 
                      getting veneers to improve your smile. These are created 
                      using a novel composite resin that is stronger than conventional 
                      porcelain and enables the use of thinner layers to create a veneer
                      with a natural appearance. They are therefore the perfect 
                      option if you have one or more teeth that need small adjustments 
                      to look their best. They're also the best option if you have gingival 
                      recession because this treatment allows you to keep as much of the gum 
                      tissue surrounding your teeth as possible.<br><br>
                    
                      When it comes to safeguarding healthy teeth and keeping them free 
                      of unwelcome stains or discolouration, there is still no replacement 
                      for basic dental care. Your smile's look can be immediately improved by 
                      professional teeth whitening. But thanks to modern cosmetic dentistry, you 
                      can be proud of your smile. <br><br>
                    </dd><br>

                    <dt style="color: black;">7. Removable Veneers</dt><br>
                    <dd style="color: black;">There are detachable solutions available if the severity 
                      of your oral issues prevents you from being a candidate for 
                      permanent porcelain veneers. These are affixed over your teeth 
                      with small metal posts that fit into the grooves in your bite and 
                      can be made of composite resin. Removable veneers are short-lived and 
                      should be taken out before brushing or eating, but they efficiently correct 
                      little cosmetic faults like gaps or chipping. However, there are numerous 
                      types of dental veneer choices available if you're interested in making little 
                      adjustments that can instantly improve how you feel and appear when you smile.</dd><br>

                    
                      <dt style="color: black;">8. Palatal Veneers</dt><br>
                      <dd style="color: black;">If you want porcelain veneers but don't have enough tooth 
                        structure remaining to support them securely, they are an 
                        excellent option. Palatal veneers are also an option even if you 
                        have lost teeth or are unable to prepare the area for conventional 
                        porcelain veneers by bonding because they are frequently used in 
                        conjunction with other dental work and use the nearby teeth as anchors.</dd><br>

                      <dt style="color: black;">9. Cantilever Veneers</dt><br>
                      <dd style="color: black;">A cantilever dental bridge is a type that is employed 
                        when there aren't enough teeth on each side of a restoration 
                        area. After acquiring your new veneer, this kind of setup enables 
                        you to move both teeth closer together, which frequently produces a 
                        far more natural appearance than was possible before veneers were applied.</dd><br>

            <h4 style="color: black;">How do you determine which is best for you?</h4><br>
            <p class="texts2">A <i style="color: black;">crown</i> is probably the best choice if your
                tooth has a big filling, a root canal, or is severely worn down or broken.<br><br>
                A <i style="color: black;">veneer</i> might be the ideal choice if your tooth is essentially 
                healthy and the repair is only for aesthetic reasons. 
                <i style="color: black;">Veneers </i>can also be used to make slight form adjustments.
